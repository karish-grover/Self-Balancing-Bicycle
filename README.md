A Self Balancing bicycle, based on Inverse Pendulum Concept.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

A large number of health conscious people in today’s world prefer to commute via bi-cyles. A
larger proportion of children invest a decent amount of their time , cycling . Our project aims to
provide an altogether new cycling experience. What if your cycle comes automatically to the
place where you want it to come?
Our project solves the following problems:
1. Consumes time in fetching ones bi-cycle from the parked location
2. Stealing of cycle is a very common problem.
3. Safety issues (Falling off cycle etc).
4. No-headlights harden visibility at night
5. Extensive air pollution

**PROOF OF SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PROBLEM**

● Bicycle theft is a high volume crime, yet has been the subject of limited academic
attention. Bicycles are attractive targets for theft. They are widely available (increasingly
so in many urban settings), easy to use, easy to sell and, critically, often left poorly
secured despite their high value. Police detection rates are traditionally low - in England
and Wales detection rates are around 5% - in part because many victims of cycle theft
cannot provide any information on who stole their bicycle. But an additional tracker on
bicycle makes you find it easily.

● Upon talking to the neighbours, they stress upon the problem of finding their cycles
when they are parked in stands with many others. Even my friends in foreign Universities
mention this. It can get really agitating when you're not able to find your cycle, when
you're running late for a class or tuition, worse if it is in the morning.

● Road accidents, we all know is a common problem. However, they are not always one
car banging into cycles. Sometimes the rider loses control too. There cannot be a significant data to back this claim, since a rider will refuse to accept that it was his fault in order to get money from the driver of a motor vehicle. However, as per safety this
self-balancing system can reduce these accidents tremendously.

● Mostly cycles don’t have headlights. The rider rides at pure instinct at night. We equip
our cycles with a headlight, making the rider to see the road. Then we are equipping the
tires of the cycle with kinetically charging LED’s. They will charge upon themselves while
the wheel rotates and they’ll make the cycle visible to the drivers of other vehicles.
Majorly reducing road accidents at night.

● Everyone knows Delhi’s pollution level is on all time high. Promoting such fancy products
gives consumers an edge to actually buy cycles. If this comes true and people start to
shift to these cycles for there small distance movement. Then we can reduce pollution
by a significant amount.

**PROOF OF NOVELTY OF THE PROBLEM OR PROPOSED SOLUTION**

The novelty of the project is highlighted by the following points:
1. A self balancing bicycle has never been practically implemented
2. The bicycle steers itself from one point to another just by a stimulus
3. The bicycle can be tracked at anytime using the gps
4. It can even be remotely controlled using a joystick for parking
